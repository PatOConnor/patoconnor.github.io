<p>I'm starting on this data visualization project today. My intention is to show my ability to create a focused  roadmap and commit to it to finish a project within a preset deadline.</p>
<br>
<p>The first dataset I'm looking at is the list of certified businesses in boston. I want to compare the certifications to the locations, possibly combine that with other location data from other datasets, and discern something from the 'services provided blurb, even if what I can do right away is just search for common words.</p>
<br>    
<p>Looking at the dataset, I'm shocked at how much is publically available like this. The first problem is deciding which pieces of the dataset to compare. I decided to go with visualizing data about women-owned businesses.</p>
<br>    
<p>I broke down the data into which category of business each woman-owned business is. I'm going to look at this data and see which wuestions I can come up with to answer.</p>
<br>
<p>I also started building a personal website, mostly to host this blog.</p>
