<h3>Boston Data Figure 1</h3>
<h6>8 am</h6>
<p> I decided to  start work by making a stacked line chart (the proper name escapes me at the moment).</p>
<h6>9 am</h6>
<p> my first step was to enumerate the presence of different certificates to an nx3 array. I have that, and now the task is to find the best way to visualize it.</p>
<h6>9:30 am </h6>
<p> I've decided the data should be visualized as a stacked histogram, color-coded to red and blue. green would be used for any businesses that exclusively have a veteran certificate, but there are none.</p>
<p> Within the red section, different shades of red are used to distinguish businesses that possess other certificates.</p>
<h6>10:30 am</h6>
<p>I've written up the different occurences and paired them up with colors, but i feel like I've coded myself into a corner. I don't want to get rid of the structure I've started generating but i feel like a 1D array solution is better. I'm going to do something else for a while.</p>
