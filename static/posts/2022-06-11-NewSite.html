<h4>New Website Design Kinda</h4>
<p>
    Today and yesterday i reconfigured the site to have a grid layout, and I feel 
    good about where I've gotten it. I need a logo or something though, the title 
    card feels very naked.

    I think the next step for the website itself is to use bootstrap to make it 
    look better, but i think it's more prudent to add actual content to the website.
