<h4>Working on the skyrim alchemist</h4>>
<p>What am i doing today?</p>

<p>I feel like i don't know enough about data itself to do this dataviz,
 so i'm going to learn some statistics.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I'll grind coding websites and finish up the skyrim tool.</p>

<p>Working on the skyrim alchemist has been tough. my undestanding of the problem is:</p>

<ul>

<li>given a list of N-many items of type ITEM=A_abc B_abc C_abc D_abc, </li>
<li>where A,B,C,D are attributes that match items up</li>
<li>a,b,c are contextual multipliers to the values of A,B,C, or D</li>

</ul>
<p>How do you match up the items N in lists of 2 or three such that the sum of the products is maximized?</p>

<p>The ingredients are sirted such that A > B > C, etc</p>


<p>I've gotten it to the point where it matches up potions in pairs, but now i need to figure out what
   the algorithm will be when it matches up to make 3-ingr potions. I'm worried I may need to start over 
   with better relational data structure, but hopefully I'l be able to get it working without
   a total upheaval.</p>

<p>Either way, the version as it is now is uploaded and available for download!</p>


<p>It feels really good to finally upload this. </p>
