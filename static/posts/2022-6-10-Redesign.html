<p>I'm writing these posts in HTML and itr doesn't feel like the right way to be doing things.</p>
<p>Thew way my site is set up is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I writeb blogposts and the inner html of my site in /static/fragments, 
        /static/posts/, and /static/templates</li>
    <li>I run python scripts in /tools/ to generate the static webpages for 
        my JS-not-enabled website</li>
</ul>
