<h3>Cambridge Free Stuff Finder</h3>

<p>This is a script I wrote for a friend that checks your local craiglist to see if there's any new free stuff.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>performs an automated search of craigslist</li>
    <li>able to do multiple search queries and display all results</li>
</ul>

<h4>How it Works</h4>
<ul>
    <li>it keeps a small local database of items it has already scanned for, so it doesn't display any duplicates.</li>
    <li>You set your postal code, distance radius, subdomain, and any search phrases in the config file</li>
    <li>In the config file, set RESET equal to True to delete pre-existing data from the database.</li>
    <li>Note: Has only been tested for USA craigslist</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technologies</h4>
<ul>
    <li>BeautifulSoup</li>
    <li>textualize/rich</li>
</ul>
