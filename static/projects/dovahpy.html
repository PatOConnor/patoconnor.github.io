<h3>DovahPy</h3>

<p>This program is a set of tools intended to make playing skyrim on PC easier</p>
<p>The idea is that instead of looking up a bunch of individual items when making 
    console commands, you can use command builder to generate them all at once.</p>
<p>The alchemist package briefly inputs keypresses to get your inventory info, 
    so it needs to be executed with administrator privileges.</p>
