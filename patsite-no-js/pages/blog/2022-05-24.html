     I'm starting on this data visualization project today. My intention is to show my ability to create a focused  roadmap and commit to it to finish a project within a preset deadline.
    </p>

    <p>
     The first dataset I'm looking at is the list of certified businesses in boston. I want to compare the certifications to the locations, possibly combine that with other location data from other datasets, and discern something from the 'services provided blurb, even if what I can do right away is just search for common words.
    </p>

    <p>
     Looking at the dataset, I'm shocked at how much is publically available like this. The first problem is deciding which pieces of the dataset to compare. I decided to go with visualizing data about women-owned businesses.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
     I broke down the data into which category of business each woman-owned business is. I'm going to look at this data and see which wuestions I can come up with to answer.
