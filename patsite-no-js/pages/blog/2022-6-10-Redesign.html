    <p>
     I'm writing these posts in HTML and it doesn't feel like the right way to be doing things.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
     So far, I feel like I'm doing good. It's very complicated setting it all up, 
    but it's worth it to see it all come together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thew way my site is set up is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      The root folder contains an index.html page to direct the 
        user towards the different versions of the site.
     </li>
     <li>
      Within the root folder, there is:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Root folders of the websites themselves
       </li>
       <li>
        /static/, which contains the building blocks of the website
       </li>
       <li>
        /tools/ which contains scripts used to generate the static website
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Within /static/, there is:
      <ul>
       <li>
        /fragments/, which contains HTML snippets 
            that get combined into webpages
       </li>
       <li>
        /images/,
       </li>
       <li>
        /posts/, which contains blog articles
       </li>
       <li>
        /templates/, which contains boilerplates of pages
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      How do I work on the the website?
      <ul>
       <li>
        To ppublish to the blog: Write a Blog post in /static/posts with a 
            filename in the format "YYYY-MM-DD-Title" and run the refresh blog script
       </li>
       <li>
        To add a project, write the inner code in /static/projects and generate 
            the full page with the script.
       </li>
       <li>
        The website updates when i commit to it
       </li>
       <li>
        The projects index and projects section on the homepage is hardcoded
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      What's my next task?
      <ul>
       <li>
        Make the templates for the index and project pages
       </li>
       <li>
        Make page generators for the templates
       </li>
       <li>
        Start writing up webpages for the projects
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
