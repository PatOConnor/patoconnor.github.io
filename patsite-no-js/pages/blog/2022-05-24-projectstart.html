     I'm starting on this data visualization project today. My intention is to show my ability to create a focused  roadmap and commit to it to finish a project within a preset deadline.

     The first dataset I'm looking at is the list of certified businesses in boston. I want to compare the certifications to the locations, possibly combine that with other location data from other datasets, and discern something from the 'services provided blurb, even if what I can do right away is just search for common words.

     Looking at the dataset, I'm shocked at how much is publically available like this. The first problem is deciding which pieces of the dataset to compare. I decided to go with visualizing data about women-owned businesses.

     I broke down the data into which category of business each woman-owned business is. I'm going to look at this data and see which wuestions I can come up with to answer.

     I also started building a personal website, mostly to host this blog.
